<p>My philosophy is the memex is already here.  But everyone must build their own.  Here are hacks for how I've built mine. My main goal was to be able to retrieve anything I read.  I achieve that in two ways 1) leave a trace memory system and 2) Workflowy Bucket. There's a lot of other small tools I use. </p>
