<h2>Social Media Automation</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>August 2013</b></p>

<p>I'm obsessed with efficiency and automation.  I built a company (<a href="http://www.sockclub.com">Sock Club</a>) that delivers socks to your door so you have less to worry about.  Socks should be automatic and look good so you're excited to wear them.  Sock Club has used social media to connect with current and potential customers.  Because I'm obsessed with automation, I've been looking for a simple tool that would automatically post to twitter and facebook when we updated our blog or post to our blog when we made a new pinterest board.  I don't enjoy posting the same content to all our different social media channels (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram, ...).</p>

<p> When <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> launched I thought "what a great idea" then quickly forgot about it, because it wasn't obvious what I'd use it for.  I was reminded of the service by a non-techy friend so I knew it must be doing well and easy to use.  While giving it another try I realized although it wasn't explicitly a social media automation tool it had the capabilities I always wanted in one.  <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> is the prefect social media tool for <a href="http://www.sockclub.com">Sock Club</a>. Right now we only have three recipes (pictured below) that make sure our tumblr posts go out to our facebook and twitter friends, but we plan on adding much more.  </p>
