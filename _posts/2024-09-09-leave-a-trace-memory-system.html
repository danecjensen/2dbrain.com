<h2>Always Leave A Trace Memory System</h2>

One effective hack to remember is always leave a trace by like "hearting" a Twitter post or "upvoting" a HN post or "staring" a GitHub repo. You're brain will usually remember where you read something so you just have to go to that site and then search through your activity.
