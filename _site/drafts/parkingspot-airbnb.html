I came up with this idea after reading this <a href="http://www.quora.com/Craigslist/Why-hasnt-another-product-disrupted-and-replaced-Craigslist" target="_blank">http://www.quora.com/Craigslist/Why-hasnt-another-product-disrupted-and-replaced-Craigslist</a>.  I'm not going to argue whether or not Craigslist has been disrupted.  From my experience lately using craigslist has become a pretty big hassle.  I've been having a lot of trouble selling a mattress and buying a motorcycle.  The question provides a good place for coming up with new startup ideas.  Craigslist isn't the best medium for a lot of business that gets done there.  Specialization is difficult because there are many different types of transactions completed through Craigslist.  They also haven't made much of an effort to specialize for each transaction.  The failure of Craigslist to specialize in how it deals with different transaction is unfortunate because many transactions are smoother when a third party makes an effort to display information in the most organize fashion (i.e. maps and/or professional pictures), some items aren't time sensitive so they shouldn't have to be reposted,  and makes sure dealers are trustworthy.

<h3><strong>How I would implement a Airbnb for parking spaces:</strong></h3>
<strong> </strong>

<strong> </strong>

The web application is fairly simple.  Airbnb has a big emphasis on design I think thats more important for what their doing.  Parking is about convenience.  The mobile part is obviously important build nice Android and iPhone apps.  Make sure your web app is simple for mobile.

The hard part is getting users.  Here is how I would approach acquiring users.  Launch when there is a huge event and the demand for parking is high.  Buy all of the parking spaces post to Craigslist instruct the owners to change their post to one you've built that redirects to your site.  For example,  I live in Austin and would launch during SXSW.  I corner the parking space market by buying all the craigslist spots.  It would obviously be extremely expensive to do this I'm estimating between $10k and $100k , but you will probably make that back.  On a side note, as a mathematician and computer scientist I have to talk about this, by owning all the parking spaces people will have to go through you and you'll be privy to data that will help to correctly value a parking space.  I personally would invest time before cornering the market on developing an algorithm to correctly value parking space based on this data.
