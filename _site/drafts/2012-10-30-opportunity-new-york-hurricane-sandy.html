        <p><b>October 2012</b></p>
        <p>After a disaster like Hurricane Sandy there is always opportunity.  Disasters bring out the best in people.  People are eager to rebuild.  There's a great medium nowadays for organizing people to rebuild... the internet.  If I were a web hacker in New York (or somewhere else hit by Hurricane Sandy), I'd take advantage of this opportunity.  I would buy a url like hurricanesandyrelief.com, put up a <a href="http://www.launchrock.com">launchrock.com page</a> to collect emails, and then promote the page on Facebook and Twitter.  People are already asking to help others, but don't have a centralized place to put their efforts.  I'm positive you would collect a lot of emails from people.  You now have a supply of volunteers to help and you need to find the demand for help.  Finding where you're group of volunteers could help should be equally as easy put "if you need help please email us at hurricanesandyhelp@gmail.com" on the launchrock page.  Also, contact government officials to see what work needs to be done and where volunteers can help out.  It's gonna be a logistical nightmare to connect the two but I'm sure with help from some friends and some coffee you can get the work done.</p>

        <p>Obviously this isn't the only way to help out.  You could also just find the local red cross and volunteer.  But if you roll up your sleeve and go the extra mile to do this I bet it will have a larger impact.  It makes more sense for someone in New York to organize people and execute a plan like this, but I'm more than happy to help from the sidelines in Austin.  If you're a person with hustle in New York email me.  I'd be happy to use my web skills to do good.</p>
