## Welcome to Spreadsheets2x

Spreadsheets2x is a project to build a toolbox of scripts for converting spreadsheets into anything. 

Lots of interesting projects get stuck because people don't have the time or know how to convert a spreadsheet into some html or encoding that will bring it's content to life.   

Spreadsheets2x looks to change all that by building a toolbox of scripts (i.e. bash, javascript and python scripts) for converting simple spreadsheets into maps, apis, static sites, infographics, etc. 

If you have a project or spreadsheet that you want converted into something else please fill out our form here.
