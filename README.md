## Welcome to Spreadsheets2x

Spreadsheets2x is a project to build a toolbox of scripts for converting spreadsheets into anything. 

Lots of interesting projects get stuck because people don't have the time or know how to convert a spreadsheet into some html or encoding that will bring it's contents to life. Spreadsheets2x looks to change all that by building a toolbox of scripts (i.e. bash, javascript and python scripts) for converting simple spreadsheets into maps, apis, static sites, infographics, etc. 

If you have a project or spreadsheet that you want converted into anything for free please email us spreadsheets2x@gmail.com with the spreadsheet and a description of what you want the output to be.
